This webapp replicates a Unix-like terminal environment in your web browser. 
It simulates the experience of using a command-line interface, complete with a 
virtual file system, various commands, and interactive features.

A terminal (also called a command line, shell, or console) is a text-based 
interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. Unlike graphical 
user interfaces (GUIs) that use windows, icons, and menus, terminals rely on 
typed commands.

Terminals have been the primary way to interact with computers since the early 
days of computing.
