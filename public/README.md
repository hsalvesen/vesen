This webapp replicates a Unix-like terminal environment in your web browser. 
It simulates the experience of using a command-line interface, complete with a 
virtual file system, various commands, and interactive features.

A terminal (also called a command line, shell, or console) is a text-based 
interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. Unlike graphical 
user interfaces (GUIs) that use windows, icons, and menus, terminals rely on 
typed commands.  Try running `cat history.txt` to discover more.

Terminals have been the primary way to interact with computers since the early 
days of computing.
